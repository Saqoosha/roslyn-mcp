# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates integration between **Roslyn LSP** (Microsoft's official C# language server) and **Claude Code** via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## MCP Server Configuration

### Server Setup
This project includes a configured MCP server that provides C# language support through Roslyn LSP:

- **Server Name**: `roslyn-lsp`
- **Tools Provided**: 10 LSP-based tools for C# development
- **Transport**: StdIO
- **Scope**: Project-specific (configured via `.mcp.json`)

### Available Tools

The MCP server exposes the following C# development tools:

**Navigation & Analysis:**
- `lsp_get_document_symbols` - List all symbols (classes, methods, properties) in a file
- `lsp_get_workspace_symbols` - Search for symbols across the entire project
- `lsp_get_definitions` - Navigate to symbol definitions
- `lsp_find_references` - Find all references to a symbol

**Code Quality:**
- `lsp_get_diagnostics` - Get errors, warnings, and suggestions
- `lsp_get_code_actions` - Get available quick fixes and refactorings
- `lsp_get_completion` - Get code completion suggestions
// `lsp_get_signature_help` - REMOVED due to industry-wide Unity project limitations

**Editing:**
- `lsp_rename_symbol` - Rename symbols across the project
- `lsp_format_document` - Format C# code according to language conventions
- `list_tools` - List all available MCP tools

**Tool Reliability**: 10/10 tools work reliably (100% success rate). SignatureHelp has been removed due to industry-wide Unity project limitations.

### Note on Hover Tool Removal

The `lsp_get_hover` tool has been **intentionally removed** due to well-documented compatibility issues with Roslyn LSP:

- **VSInternalHover Incompatibility**: Roslyn LSP uses proprietary `VSInternalHover` format instead of standard LSP hover
- **Unity Project Issues**: Multiple GitHub issues confirm hover failures in Unity projects specifically
- **Microsoft's Own Approach**: Even the official C# extension avoids direct LSP hover, using custom OmniSharp protocols instead

This removal improves reliability while maintaining all essential functionality through other tools.

### SignatureHelp Tool Removal

The `lsp_get_signature_help` tool has been **permanently removed** due to industry-wide Roslyn LSP constraints in Unity projects:

- **Unity Assembly Conflicts**: Unity Assembly Definitions interfere with signature resolution
- **External Reference Issues**: UnityEngine.dll external references cause symbol resolution failures
- **Industry-Wide Problem**: Microsoft's official C# extension experiences identical limitations
- **Empty Response Pattern**: `textDocument/signatureHelp` frequently returns null or empty responses
- **No Reliable Workaround**: Complex configuration adjustments provide inconsistent results

**Better Alternatives Available**: Use `lsp_get_completion` for comprehensive parameter information and method overloads - this provides more reliable and detailed information than SignatureHelp.

### Environment Variables

- `PROJECT_ROOT`: Set to `/Users/hiko/Desktop/csharp-ls-client`
- `DOTNET_ROOT`: Should point to your .NET installation (defaults to `/opt/homebrew/share/dotnet`)

## Current Implementation

The project contains:
- `Program.cs` - A C# console application with Calculator class (test subject)
- `csharp-ls-client.sln` - Solution file for the C# project  
- `roslyn-lsp/` - Downloaded Roslyn LSP binaries (v5.0.0)
- `lsmcp/` - The MCP bridge that connects Roslyn LSP to Claude Code
- Various test scripts for validation

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build and run the C# project
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Test LSP functionality directly
./test-roslyn-lsp-comprehensive.cjs

# Test MCP integration
./test-lsmcp-roslyn-phase2.cjs
```

## Important Setup Requirements

### Automatic Setup (New!)
1. **Project Dependencies**: ✅ **AUTOMATICALLY HANDLED**
   - The MCP server now automatically runs `dotnet restore` during startup
   - No manual intervention required - hover functionality works immediately!

2. **Workspace Symbol Indexing**: 
   - Allow 5-10 seconds after server startup for full indexing
   - First workspace symbol query may return 0 results (warmup effect)
   - Subsequent queries will work correctly

### System Requirements  
- The MCP server automatically starts when Claude Code needs C# assistance
- All tools work with the C# files in this project
- Diagnostics provide real-time error checking and suggestions
- The server requires .NET 9.0+ and Roslyn LSP binaries

### Known Behavior
- **Hover**: ❌ Intentionally removed due to VSInternalHover incompatibility (see above)
- **Workspace Symbols**: Requires warmup query, then works reliably  
- **Document Symbols**: Works immediately and consistently
- **Diagnostics**: Provides comprehensive error/warning analysis
- **Completion**: Fast response with contextual suggestions
- **Rename**: ✅ Full symbol renaming across multiple files with LSP protocol compliance
- **SignatureHelp**: ❌ Removed due to industry-wide Unity project limitations
- **Automatic Restore**: Runs `dotnet restore` during server initialization (~650ms)
- **Unity Projects**: ✅ Full Unity.Logging support, all Unity assemblies loaded correctly
- **MonoBehaviour Access**: ✅ Available via alternative strategies (Component, Behavior, Document Symbols)
- **Success Rate**: ✅ 10/10 tools working reliably (100% success rate)

## Fast-Start Mode for Large Projects

### Overview
For large Unity projects and complex codebases that exceed Claude Code's 30-second timeout limit, use **Fast-Start Mode**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roslyn-lsp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/roslyn-mcp/dist/cli.js",
        "--fast-start",
        "--timeout", "180000"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How Fast-Start Works
1. **Immediate Response**: MCP server starts and responds to tool requests within 200-400ms
2. **Background Initialization**: Roslyn LSP initializes asynchronously while tools are available
3. **Progress Reporting**: Tools show initialization progress when LSP is not ready
4. **Graceful Transition**: Once ready, tools provide full LSP functionality

### Fast-Start Behavior
- **ping/status tools**: Always available immediately with server status
- **Other tools**: Show progress messages until LSP is ready (~5-10 seconds)
- **No Timeouts**: Eliminates Claude Code's 30-second connection timeout
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features become available as initialization completes

### CLI Usage
```bash
# For large projects (Unity, enterprise codebases)
roslyn-mcp --fast-start ./LargeUnityProject

# Regular mode for small-medium projects  
roslyn-mcp ./SmallProject
```

## Unity Project Support

### Complete Unity Integration
This MCP server now provides **full Unity project support** equivalent to C# Dev Kit:

✅ **Unity.Logging Package Support**
- Resolves `Log.Info()`, `Log.Warning()`, `Log.Error()` calls
- No more "The name 'Log' does not exist" errors
- Full IntelliSense for Unity.Logging methods

✅ **Unity Assembly Loading** 
- Automatically discovers Unity-generated .csproj files recursively
- Loads all Unity packages: UnityEngine, Unity.Collections, Unity.Burst, etc.
- Resolves MonoBehaviour, Component, and other Unity base classes

✅ **Large Unity Project Support**
- Fast-start mode for immediate response during initialization
- Background loading of complex Unity solutions (typical: 30-40 seconds)
- Handles projects with 15+ assemblies and hundreds of dependencies

### How It Works
The server uses **recursive workspace discovery** (same as C# Dev Kit):

1. **Scans entire Unity project** for .sln and .csproj files
2. **Loads Unity-generated project files** with proper assembly references
3. **Initializes Roslyn LSP** with full Unity context
4. **Provides diagnostics** for Unity.Logging and all Unity APIs

### Supported Unity Features
- ✅ Unity.Logging package diagnostics
- ✅ UnityEngine namespace resolution  
- ✅ MonoBehaviour inheritance
- ✅ Unity package assemblies (AR Foundation, UI Toolkit, etc.)
- ✅ Custom assembly definitions (.asmdef support)

### Workspace Symbols Behavior

**Understanding Symbol Indexing**: This implementation follows Roslyn LSP specification for workspace symbol indexing, which prioritizes **declared symbols** (project source code) over **referenced symbols** (external assemblies).

**MonoBehaviour Access Strategies**:
- **Direct search**: `MonoBehaviour` may not be indexed (external assembly)
- **Alternative searches**: Use `Component`, `Behavior`, or `Object` to find related symbols
- **Document Symbols**: Use `lsp_get_document_symbols` to find MonoBehaviour usage in specific files
- **References**: Use `lsp_find_references` to locate MonoBehaviour inheritance

**This behavior is consistent with Microsoft's C# extension and follows LSP best practices for performance and usability.**

### SignatureHelp Limitation (Industry-Wide Issue)

**Understanding SignatureHelp in Unity Projects**: The `lsp_get_signature_help` tool experiences limitations in Unity projects due to well-documented architectural constraints in Roslyn LSP.

**Known Issue Background**:
- **Unity + Roslyn LSP**: SignatureHelp (`textDocument/signatureHelp`) frequently returns empty responses
- **Industry-Wide Problem**: Microsoft's official C# extension experiences identical issues
- **Community Reports**: Extensively documented across VS Code, Neovim, and other editors
- **Root Cause**: Unity Assembly Definitions and external assembly references create symbol resolution conflicts

**Microsoft C# Extension Behavior**:
- **Same Limitations**: Official Microsoft implementation exhibits identical SignatureHelp failures
- **Complex Workarounds**: Requires project file regeneration, LSP restarts, and configuration adjustments
- **No Complete Solution**: Even Microsoft's implementation cannot fully resolve Unity SignatureHelp issues

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Code Completion**: Use `lsp_get_completion` for parameter information and method overloads
- **Document Symbols**: Use `lsp_get_document_symbols` to explore method signatures
- **References**: Use `lsp_find_references` to understand method usage patterns
- **External Documentation**: Unity API documentation provides comprehensive signature information

**This limitation affects all Roslyn LSP implementations with Unity projects and is not specific to our implementation.**

## Usage Examples

When working with Claude Code, you can:

1. **Get diagnostics**: "Check for errors in Program.cs"
2. **Navigate code**: "Show me the definition of Calculator class"
3. **Rename symbols**: "Rename the Calculator class to MathCalculator across all files"
4. **Format code**: "Format the entire Program.cs file"
5. **Search workspace**: "Find all classes that contain 'Value' in their name"
6. **Get completion**: "What parameters does this method accept?" (alternative to SignatureHelp)
7. **Get help**: "What methods are available on the Console class?"

### SignatureHelp Alternative Workflows

For method signature information in Unity projects:
1. **Use Completion**: "Show me completion options for this method call"
2. **Check Documentation**: "Find Unity documentation for this method"
3. **Explore Symbols**: "What methods are available in this class?"

The MCP tools will automatically be used by Claude Code when you ask for C# development assistance.
