- TypeScript project setup with ESM modules ✓
- Build system (tsup) configured ✓
- Test framework (vitest) configured ✓
- Core project structure established ✓

## ✅ Phase 1.2: Basic MCP Server - COMPLETE
- MCP server implementation working ✓
- Tool registration system functional ✓
- Ping tool implemented and tested ✓
- Server responds to initialization ✓
- Tools list properly ✓

## ✅ Phase 1.3: Roslyn LSP Client - COMPLETE
- LSP client implementation complete ✓
- Process management working ✓
- Path resolution fixed and verified ✓
- LSP binary found at correct location ✓

## ✅ Phase 1.4: First LSP Bridge Tool (Hover) - COMPLETE
- Hover tool implemented ✓
- Tool properly registered in MCP server ✓
- Tool executes and communicates with LSP ✓
- Error handling working (LSP errors properly returned) ✓

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Basic MCP Server Test
```
✅ Server initialized successfully!
✅ Tools listed successfully!
Available tools: ping, hover
```

### Path Resolution Test
```
Resolved LSP path: /Users/hiko/Desktop/csharp-ls-client/roslyn-mcp/runtime/roslyn-lsp/content/LanguageServer/osx-arm64/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer
File exists: true
```

### Hover Functionality Test
```
✅ Hover tool executes
✅ Communicates with LSP server
⚠️ LSP returns error: "Document is null when it was required for textDocument/hover"
```

## 📝 Notes

The LSP error is expected behavior - Roslyn LSP requires documents to be opened before querying them. This is a normal LSP workflow issue that will be addressed in Phase 2 when we implement:
- Document synchronization
- textDocument/didOpen notifications
- Proper LSP session management

## 🎯 Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE

All Phase 1 objectives have been achieved:
1. **Project Bootstrap** - Full TypeScript/ESM setup with build and test infrastructure
2. **MCP Server** - Working server with tool registration and ping tool
3. **LSP Client** - Complete implementation with proper path resolution
4. **Hover Tool** - Implemented and integrated, ready for Phase 2 document management

The foundation is solid and ready for Phase 2 implementation!
