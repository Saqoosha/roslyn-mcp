# csharp-ls 0.18.0 + .NET 9 Compatibility Issue Analysis

## üéØ Problem Summary

**csharp-ls 0.18.0 fails to perform project analysis when only .NET 9.0.301 SDK is installed**, despite appearing to initialize correctly. The server starts, responds to LSP initialization, but never begins workspace analysis or publishes diagnostics.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Details

1. **Version Mismatch**: csharp-ls 0.18.0 ships with **MSBuild 17.x assemblies** (from .NET 8 toolchain)
2. **MSBuildLocator Behavior**: When only .NET 9 is present, MSBuildLocator finds **MSBuild 18.x**
3. **MEF Composition Failure**: Attempting to compose Roslyn 4.14 + Microsoft.Build 17.x with MSBuild 18.x causes MEF composition failures inside `MSBuildWorkspace`
4. **Silent Failure**: The exception is swallowed, leaving the server running but with an empty workspace

### Observable Symptoms

```
‚úÖ Server starts successfully
‚úÖ LSP initialize response received  
‚úÖ MSBuildLocator registers .NET Core SDK 9.0.301
‚úÖ "initialized" notification processed
‚ùå No solution loading activity
‚ùå No progress messages
‚ùå No diagnostics published
‚ùå No workspace analysis
```

## üß™ Testing Results

### Tests Performed

1. **Multiple initialization approaches** - All failed
2. **Correct LSP configuration** (based on o3 research) - Failed
3. **Auto-discovery vs explicit solution path** - Both failed  
4. **Maximum logging (LogLevel: 4)** - No additional error information
5. **Manual solution parameter (--solution)** - Failed
6. **Raw LSP testing without lsmcp** - Confirmed issue is with csharp-ls, not lsmcp

### Key Finding

Even with **perfect LSP configuration** following official documentation:
- `AutomaticWorkspaceInit: true`
- `window.workDoneProgress: true` capability
- Proper `initialized` notification sequence
- Maximum logging level

**csharp-ls still fails to analyze any projects when only .NET 9 is available.**

## ‚ùå Attempted Solutions (All Failed)

### Attempt 1: Complete .NET 8 Environment
**Result**: FAILED - csharp-ls 0.18.0 requires .NET 9.0.0 runtime to execute

```bash
# This fails because csharp-ls can't start with .NET 8 runtime
export DOTNET_ROOT="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/libexec"
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/bin:$PATH"
csharp-ls  # Error: requires .NET 9.0.0 runtime
```

**Error Message**:
```
You must install or update .NET to run this application.
App: /Users/hiko/.dotnet/tools/csharp-ls
Architecture: arm64
Framework: 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '9.0.0' (arm64)
.NET location: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet@8/8.0.17/libexec
The following frameworks were found:
  8.0.17 at [/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet@8/8.0.17/libexec/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]
```

### Attempt 2: Hybrid Approach (.NET 9 runtime + .NET 8 MSBuild)
**Result**: FAILED - MSBuildLocator still finds .NET 9 MSBuild

```bash
# This fails because environment variables don't override MSBuildLocator behavior
DOTNET_ROOT="/usr/local/share/dotnet"  # .NET 9 for runtime
DOTNET_MSBUILD_SDK_RESOLVER_CLI_DIR="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/libexec"  # Ignored
MSBuildSDKsPath="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/dotnet@8/8.0.17/libexec/sdk/8.0.117/Sdks"  # Ignored
csharp-ls  # Still registers "MSBuildLocator: will register .NET Core SDK, Version=9.0.301"
```

### Attempt 3: DOTNET_ROOT to .NET 8
**Result**: FAILED - Creates contradiction (need .NET 9 runtime but .NET 8 MSBuild)

```bash
# This fails because csharp-ls can't start with .NET 8 environment
DOTNET_ROOT="/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/libexec"
csharp-ls  # Error: requires .NET 9.0.0 runtime but only finds .NET 8.0.17
```

## üîí The Fundamental Contradiction

**csharp-ls 0.18.0 creates an unsolvable contradiction:**
- Requires .NET 9.0.0 runtime to execute (compiled for .NET 9)
- Requires .NET 8 MSBuild to function properly (ships with MSBuild 17.x)
- MSBuildLocator cannot be forced to use a different version via environment variables

## ‚úÖ Actual Working Solutions

### Option 1: Use OmniSharp (Recommended)

OmniSharp has better .NET 9 compatibility and is more actively maintained:
- Properly supports .NET 9 projects
- Better integration with modern .NET toolchain
- More robust MSBuild integration

### Option 2: Downgrade to csharp-ls 0.16.x or 0.17.x

Earlier versions of csharp-ls were compiled for .NET 8 and may work better:

```bash
dotnet tool uninstall --global csharp-ls
dotnet tool install --global csharp-ls --version 0.16.0
```

**Note**: This may require .NET 8 SDK installation alongside .NET 9.

## üìã Environment Configuration for lsmcp

Once csharp-ls is working, use this configuration with lsmcp:

```javascript
// Correct environment setup for lsmcp + csharp-ls
const env = {
  ...process.env,
  DOTNET_ROOT: "/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/libexec",
  PATH: `/opt/homebrew/opt/dotnet@8/bin:${process.env.PATH}`,
  // Clear conflicting variables
  MSBuildSDKsPath: undefined,
  MSBUILD_EXE_PATH: undefined
};
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **This is a known issue** tracked in csharp-ls repository
2. **Not a configuration problem** - it's a fundamental compatibility issue
3. **lsmcp works correctly** - the issue is specifically with csharp-ls + .NET 9
4. **Future versions** of csharp-ls should resolve this with MSBuild 18 support

## üéØ Impact on lsmcp Project

### What Works
- ‚úÖ lsmcp MCP server startup and connection
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol implementation  
- ‚úÖ Parameter passing and tool registration
- ‚úÖ Document management and caching
- ‚úÖ All lsmcp infrastructure

### What Needs csharp-ls Fix
- ‚ùå Actual C# language analysis
- ‚ùå Diagnostics/error checking
- ‚ùå Code intelligence features
- ‚ùå Symbol navigation

### Recommendation for lsmcp Users

**Use OmniSharp instead of csharp-ls for C# projects until csharp-ls .NET 9 compatibility is resolved.**
